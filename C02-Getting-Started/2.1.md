> Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of non-decreasing order.

```c
void decre_insertion_sort(int A[], int n) {
  for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
      int key = A[j];

      int i = j - 1;

      while (i >= 0 && A[i] < key) {
          A[i + 1] = A[i];
          i -= 1;
      }
      A[i + 1] = key;
  } 
}

```

> Consider the **searching problem**:

**Input:** A sequence of n numbers A = {a, a2, . . ., an} and a value v.

**Output:** An index i such that  v =  A[i] or the special value NIL if  does not appear in A.

Write pseudocode for **linear search**, which scans through the sequence, looking for v. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulﬁlls the three necessary properties.

```
for i = 0 to A.length-1
    if A[i] == v then
        return i
    end if
end for
return NIL
```

> Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an (n + 1)-element array C . State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers.

Formally, let A = [a1, a2, ..., an] and B = [b1, b2, ..., bn] be two n-element arrays representing two n-bit binary integers a and b, where ai, bi ∈ {0,1} for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The task is to compute the sum c of a and b, where c is an (n+1)-element array C = [c1, c2, ..., cn+1], such that ci = (ai + bi + carry) mod 2 and carry = (ai + bi + carry) // 2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and cn+1 = carry.

```c
void binary_sum(int A[], int B[], int C[], int n) {
  int carry = 0;
  int i = 0;

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int sum = A[i] + B[i] + carry;
    C[i] = sum % 2;
    carry = sum / 2;
  }
  
  C[i-1] = carry;
}
```
