- 2.1-2

> Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of non-decreasing order.

- 2.1-3

> Consider the **searching problem**:

**Input:** A sequence of n numbers A = {a, a2, . . ., an} and a value v.

**Output:** An index i such that  v =  A[i] or the special value NIL if  does not appear in A.

Write pseudocode for **linear search**, which scans through the sequence, looking for v. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulﬁlls the three necessary properties.

- 2.1-4

> Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an (n + 1)-element array C . State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers.
