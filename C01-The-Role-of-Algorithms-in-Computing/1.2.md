# 1.2 Algorithms as a technology

## Exercises

- 1.2-1

> Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

Application selected: "Retro 3D video game"


In this application a lot of 3D rendering algorithms are used to simulate 3D spaces in a 2D plane. Are pretty useful to make this games optimized and playable.

> Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in 8n2 steps, while merge sort runs in 64n lg n steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?

Python code:

```py
import math

def find_beat():
    a = 0
    b = 0
    n = 2
    while True:
        a = 8 * (n**2)
        b = 64 * n * math.log2(n)
        if a <= b:
            print(n)
        else:
            break

        n += 1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    find_beat()
```

According to the results, if n >= 2 && n <= 43, the insertion sort algorithm will be faster than merge sort.

> What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n2 runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2n on the same machine?

Python code:

```
def find_beat_2():
    a = 0
    b = 0
    n = 1
    while True:
        a = 100*(n**2)
        b = 2**n
        if a <= b:
            print(n)
            break
        else:
            pass
        n += 1
```

According to the results, the smallest ammount of n, that the code that runs in 100*n**2 would be faster than 2**n is 15.
