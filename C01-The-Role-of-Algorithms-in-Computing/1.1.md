> Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

A real-world example that requires sorting is the order of rendering in a display system server (For example Xorg). This is needed to know which things will be over others, apply shadows, transparency, etc...

> Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.


The Graph, this is a non-linear data structure that can be used in a lot of implementations 
Strengths:
1. Representation of Relationships: Graphs are excellent for representing relationships between objects or entities. For example, social networks can be represented as a graph, where individuals are nodes and their connections are edges.

2. Efficient Search: Graphs are efficient for searching and finding a path between two nodes. This is particularly useful in applications such as routing and navigation systems.

3. Flexibility: Graphs are a flexible data structure that can be used in a variety of applications. For instance, they can be used to represent data flow, genealogy, computer networks, and more.

4. Easy to Understand: Graphs are intuitive and easy to understand, even for non-technical users. This makes them an excellent choice for visualizing complex data.

5. Scalability: Graphs can be scaled up or down easily, depending on the size of the data set. They can be used to model small, medium, and large datasets.

Limitations:

1. Memory and Performance: Graphs can be memory-intensive, particularly for large datasets. Additionally, searching for a path in a large graph can be computationally expensive, especially when using inefficient algorithms.

2. Complexity: Graphs can be complex to understand, particularly when they are large or have many edges. Additionally, working with graphs may require a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures.

3. Sparsity: Graphs may be sparse, meaning that some nodes may have few or no edges. This can make it challenging to find a path between two nodes or to analyze the data.

4. Lack of Standardization: There is no standardization for representing graphs, and different applications may use different data structures and algorithms. This can make it challenging to work with graphs in a cross-disciplinary context.

5. Difficulty in Modification: Modifying a graph can be complex and computationally expensive. For instance, adding or deleting a node or edge can require recalculating all or part of the graph.

> How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

The shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems are both graph problems that involve finding the optimal route between two or more nodes. However, there are some key differences between the two problems:

Similarities:

    Both problems involve finding the most efficient route between two or more nodes in a graph.

    Both problems are examples of optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best solution among a set of possible solutions.

    Both problems require evaluating all possible paths in a graph and selecting the best one based on a specific criteria.

Differences:

    The shortest-path problem involves finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It is a single-source problem, meaning that the starting node is fixed, and the goal is to find the shortest path to all other nodes in the graph. In contrast, the traveling-salesman problem involves finding the shortest possible route that visits all nodes in a graph exactly once. It is a multi-source problem, where the starting node can be any node in the graph.

    The shortest-path problem is typically solved using algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, or Floyd-Warshall algorithm, whereas the traveling-salesman problem is typically solved using heuristic algorithms, such as the nearest neighbor algorithm, the 2-opt algorithm, or the simulated annealing algorithm.

    The shortest-path problem has a unique solution, whereas the traveling-salesman problem may have multiple optimal solutions.

In summary, the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems are similar in that they both involve finding the most efficient route between two or more nodes in a graph, but they differ in terms of the starting node, the solution algorithm, and the uniqueness of the solution.

> Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good enough.

A example of real-world problem that only the best solution will do is find the fibonnacci number, because bad solutions will take hours or days to end in big numbers. And the best solutions just seconds and minutes. 

Other example of "aproximately" the best is good enough The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known problem in computer science, which involves finding the shortest possible route that visits all nodes in a graph exactly once. In practice, it is often too time-consuming to find the exact optimal solution, especially for large graphs. Therefore, approximate algorithms, such as the nearest neighbor algorithm or the 2-opt algorithm, are often used to find a good but not necessarily optimal solution.
